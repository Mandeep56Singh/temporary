_________KNOW YOUR BAD HABITS OF THINKING________
All of us, for example, make generalizations when we don't have the evidence to back them up, 
we make false beliefs, tend to look at the world from one fixed point of 
view and get  confused with what is true and real, and think deceptively about many aspects of our experience


____________TO TEST YOUR THINKING___________
Beginning to Think about your Thinking
To begin to think about your thinking, make a list of any problems you believe currently exist with your 
thinking. Try to be as explicit as possible. The more problems you can identify the better. For each 
problem you identify, complete the following statements:
1. One problem with my thinking is…
2. This is a problem because

 My problems are
1 - procastinated toward thinking
     reason - thinking is difficult for me
2 - taking guidance from untrusted people
   - reason - metric on which i judge someone are not good
3 - Confuses a lot
   - less knowledge about problem
4 -indisplined and inconsistent thinking
   - indiscipline person

To develop skill you can watch expert's video, podcast etc.
Everything is associated with critical thinking so use it in every circumstance.

If we were coaching you in tennis, we would remind you 
again and again to keep your eye on the ball. Could you imagine telling your coach, "Why do I have to keep my eye on 
the ball? I already did that once." The same logic applies to the principles of skilled thinking. If you want to be 
proficient, you have to re-direct your eyes to the fundamentals, again and again and again.


_________WHERE TO LEARN CRITICAL THINKING____________
, we are likely to be introduced to the "school of hard knocks." Like it or not, we need to learn how to analyze the logic of the circumstances and persons with which we must deal and act realistically. For example, if you find yourself working in an organization, you must be prepared to take into account the actual structure of power within it, along with group definitions of reality, bureaucratic thinking, and other variables
that may diminish the quality of day-to-day thinking. 

________ CRITICAL THINKING NEEDS 3 DIMENSION THOUGHT_________


-Idealistic (and thus capable of imagining a better world)
-Realistic (and thus see things as they are). 
 -Pragmatic (and thus adopt effective measures for moving toward our ideals)

___________A well-cultivated critical thinker_________-
raises vital questions and problems, formulating them clearly and precisely;
gathers and assesses relevant information, and effectively interprets it;
comes to well-reasoned conclusions and solutions, testing them against relevant criteria and 
standards;
thinks openmindedly within alternative systems of thought, recognizing and assessing, as 
need be, their assumptions, implications, and practical consequences; and
communicates effectively with others in figuring out solutions to complex problems.
Critical thinking is, in short, self-directed, self-disciplined, self-monitored, and self-corrective thinking. It 
presupposes assent to rigorous standards of excellence and mindful command of their use. It entails 
effective communication and problem-solving abilities.

________weak vs strong critical thinking_______
Typically, people see mistakes in other's thinking without being able to credit the strengths in those opposing views. this is weak 

Perhaps even more important, strong-sense critical thinkers strive to be fair-minded. They use thinking in an ethically 
responsible manner. They work to understand and appreciate the viewpoints of others. They are willing to listen to 
arguments they do not necessarily hold. They change their views when faced with better reasoning. Rather than 
using their thinking to manipulate others and to hide from the truth (in a weak-sense way), they use thinking in an 
ethical, reasonable manner, Hence practice fair mindedness
 We treat all thinking by the same high standards. We expect good reasoning from those who 
support us as well as those who oppose us.
Don't be a selfish thinker


_________Fair Mindedness______
To be fair-minded is to strive to treat every viewpoint relevant to a situation in an unbiased, unprejudiced way.It requires us to simultaneously become intellectually 
humble, intellectually courageous, intellectually empathetic, intellectually honest, intellectually perseverant, confident 
in reason (as a tool of discovery and learning), and intellectually autonomous.

_____________Intellect Humility___________
Intellectual humility may be defined as having a consciousness of the limits of one's knowledge.  Intellectual humility depends on recognizing that one should not claim more than one actually knows.

 In addition to helping us become fair-minded thinkers,
knowledge of our ignorance can improve our thinking in a variety of ways. It can enable us to recognize the
prejudices, 
false beliefs, 
and habits of mind that lead to flawed learning. 

Consider, for example, our tendency to accept superficial learning. Much human learning is superficial. We learn a little and think we know a lot. We get limited information and generalize hastily from it.

Reward yourself for finding weaknesses in your thinking. Consider recognition of weakness an important strength, not a weakness.

1 , 	Can you construct a list of your most significant prejudices? (Think of what you believe about your country, your religion, your company, your friends, your family, simply because others—colleagues, parents, friends, peer group, media—conveyed these to you.)

2. 	Do you ever argue for or against views when you have little evidence upon which to base your judgment?

3.	Do you ever assume that your group (your company, your family, your religion, your nation, your friends) is correct (when it is in conflict with others) even though you have not looked at the situation from the point of view of the others with which you disagree?


_______________Intellectual Courage: Being Willing to Challenge Beliefs_______________________

When we do seem to consider the opposing idea, we subconsciously undermine it, presenting it in its weakest form, in order to reject it. This is one form of intellectual cowardice.

 intellectual courage is to overcome the fear of rejection by others because they hold certain beliefs and are likely to reject us if we challenge those beliefs.  Many people live their lives in the eyes of others and cannot approve of themselves unless others approve of them

______________ Intellectual Empathy: Entertaining Opposing Views ___________________________

Intellectual empathy means to  put oneself in the place of others so as to genuinely understand them. 
To have intellectual empathy is to be able to accurately reconstruct the viewpoints and reasoning of others and to reason from premises, assumptions, and ideas other than one's own

 example, you will have difficulty functioning successfully in
your job and you may often feel frustrated. If you cannot think within the viewpoints of your subordinates, you will
have difficulty understanding why they behave as they do. If you cannot think within the viewpoint of your spouse, the
quality of your marriage will be adversely affected. If you cannot think within the viewpoints of your children, they will
feel misunderstood and alienated from you.

______Intellectual Integrity: Holding Ourselves to the Same Standards to Which We Hold Others______

The opposite of intellectual integrity is intellectual hypocrisy.
Suppose I were to say to you that our relationship is really important to me, but you find out that I have lied to you about something important to you. My behavior lacks integrity. I have acted hypocritically.
Clearly, we cannot be fair to others if we are justified in thinking and acting in contradictory ways. Hypocrisy by its very nature is a form of injustice.

Think of a situation where your behavior contradicts what you say you believe.
This might be in your relationship with an employee, or a spouse, for example. Explain what
inconsistencies may be present in your behaviorss

___________Intellectual Perseverance: Working Through Complexity and Frustration___________

Some intellectual problems are complex
and cannot be easily solved. One has intellectual perseverance when one does not give up in the
face of intellectual complexity or frustration

Most people have more physical perseverance than intellectual perseverance. Most are ready to admit,
"No pain, no gain!" when talking about the body. Most give up quickly, on the other hand, when faced
with a frustrating intellectual problem. Thinking of your own responses, in your work or your personal life,
how would you evaluate your own intellectual perseverance (on a scale of 0–10)? Write out what you
are basing your score on.

________-Intellectual Autonomy: Being an Independent Thinker_______________

They have self-control. They are competent. They complete what they begin. In forming beliefs, critical thinkers do not passively accept the beliefs of others. 
Rather, they think through situations and issues for themselves and reject unjustified authorities 

___________Monitoring the Egocentrism in Your Thought and Life__________________

We are not  typically or fundamentally concerned with whether our perceptions or meanings are accurate, though we may think we are. We are not significantly concerned with personal growth, self-insight, or ultimate integrity, though we think we  are. 

The tendency for humans to think in an egocentric fashion means that, typically, we have little or no real insight into the nature of our own thinking and emotions. For example, many of us unconsciously believe that  good writing is a talent one is born with—not a product of practice and hard work. As a result, we tend to evade
responsibility for our own development. We do not seek to learn new ways of looking at things. Much of our thinking is stereotypical and simplistic, yet our egocentrism prevents us from recognizing this

This is applicable to me "  I think that don't believe in bare minimum learning  , However people claims that this system can make learning faster , I have tried but not got good hold off concept , so i doesnot feel confident about topic so i lefted this method"

"It's true because I believe it." People don't say this aloud, but we often find ourselves assuming that others
are correct when they agree with us and incorrect when they do not. The way we respond to people
indicates that we egocentrically assume we have a unique insight into the truth. 

To solve egocentrism:
 
divide our thoughts into two categories:
 1) thoughts that serve to advance the agenda of our egocentric nature 
2)thoughts that serve to develop our rational fair-mindedness.

 To effectively do this, we need to develop a special
relationship to our mind; we must become a student of our mind's operations, especially of its pathology. 

Recognizing the Mind's Three Distinctive Functions
our mind is continually communicating three kinds of things to us: 
1) what is going on in our life
2)feelings (positive or negative) about those events
3) things to pursue, where to put our energy 

_______________Understanding That You Have a Special Relationship to Your Mind_____________
For every positive thought the mind "believes," the mind naturally tends to generate a positive emotion to fit it.
Conversely, for every negative thought, the mind tends to generate a negative emotion.

For example, two people in the same situation may react completely differently, with one person experiencing pain and frustration while the other experiences curiosity and excitement.

Consider two employees faced with the task of improving office procedures in order to improve productivity. The first experiences resentment at being required to change what appears to be "working just fine." This person gives a negative meaning to the task of improvement, considering it unnecessary and time consuming (when so many other things are more important). Given the negative thinking this person is engaging in, s/he will feel negative emotions about the task.

In the same situation, another person might welcome the opportunity for improvement. Defining the situation as a chance to be creative and to think independently about ways to improve procedures, she/he looks forward to the task. Positive, rather than negative, emotions result from such a definition

The actual task at hand is precisely the same. Nevertheless, the difficulty or ease with which a person handles the
challenge, the decision to take up the challenge or avoid it altogether, ultimate success or failure, is determined
fundamentally by the manner in which the situation is interpreted through one's thinking.

When we understand the interrelated roles of thoughts, feelings, and motivation, when we can see that for every feeling state we experience, a related thought process exists that motivates us to some action, we can begin to analyze thoughts underlying our emotions and desires. If I am frustrated in a meeting, I can ask myself: What is the thinking in my mind that is leading to this feeling of frustration? What exactly am I frustrated with? What is the thinking that leads me to be frustrated .

Test the Idea
Understanding the Relationship Between the Three Functions of the Mind
Think of a situation you were in recently where you experienced a negative emotion such as anger,
frustration, depression, insecurity, or fear:

1. Write out in detail what was going on in the situation and how you felt in the situation.
Now try to figure out the thinking you were doing in the circumstance that led to the negative
feeling. Write out the thinking in detail.

2. Then write how your thinking and feeling impacted your behavior. (In other words, given the
thinking and feeling, what were you motivated to do?

_____________The First Four Stages of Development: What Level Thinker Are You?_______________

Stage 1 The Unreflective Thinker (we are unaware of significant problems in our thinking)
Stage 2 The Challenged Thinker (we become aware of problems in our thinking)
Stage 3 The Beginning Thinker (we try to improve, but without regular practice)
Stage 4 The Practicing Thinker (we recognize the necessity of regular practice)
Stage 5 The Advanced Thinker (we advance in accordance with our practice)
Stage 6 The Master Thinker (skilled and insightful thinking becomes second nature)

Stage One: The Unreflective Thinker—Are You an Unreflective Thinker?

At this stage poor thinking causes many problems in our lives, but we are unaware of this. We think of our beliefs as truth. We think of our decisions as sound. We lack intellectual standards and have no idea what such standards might be. We lack intellectual traits, but are not aware that we lack them. We unconsciously deceive ourselves in many ways. We create and maintain pleasant illusions. Our beliefs feel reasonable to us, and so we believe them with confidence
At this stage, our egocentric tendencies play a dominant role in our thinking, yet we do not recognize this.

Stage Two: The Challenged Thinker—Are You Ready to Accept the Challenge?

As we begin to become aware that "normal" thinkers often think poorly, we move into the second stage of critical thinking development. We begin to notice that we often:
-Make questionable assumptions : 
-Use false, incomplete, or misleading information;
-Make inferences that do not follow from the evidence we have;
-Fail to recognize important implications in our thought;
-Fail to recognize problems we have;
-Form faulty concepts;
-Reason within prejudiced points of view; and
-Think egocentrically and irrationally.

We are beginning to recognize that poor thinking can be life-threatening, that it can lead literally to death or permanent injury, that it can hurt others as well as ourselves. For example, we might reflect upon the thinking of:
-The person who is a perpetual procrastinator;
-The irrational manager who can't understand why his employees "don't get it;"
-The person who is angry at the world in general;
-The teenager who thinks that smoking is cool;
-The woman who thinks that Pap smears are not important;
-The motorcyclist who reasons that helmets obstruct vision and, therefore, it is safer to ride without one;
-The person who thinks he can drive safely while drunk;
-The person who decides to marry a self-centered person with the thought that he or she will "change" after-
marriage.


Stage Three: The Beginning Thinker—Are You Willing to Begin?

As beginning thinkers we are becoming aware of how to deal with the structures at work in thinking (purposes,
questions, information, interpretations, etc.). We are beginning to appreciate the value of thinking about our thinking in terms of its clarity, accuracy, relevance, precision, logicalness, justifiability, breadth, and depth. But we are still at alow level of proficiency in these activities. They feel awkward to us. We have to force ourselves to think in disciplined ways. We are like a beginner in ballet. We feel foolish adopting the basic positions. We don't feel graceful. We stumble and make mistakes. 

Let's now consider two lurking traps that can derail the beginning thinker:

Trap #1, the temptation of dogmatic absolutism—believing that truth is acquired not through
reasoning and inquiry but, rather, through some predetermined nonintellectual faith.
Trap #2, the temptation of subjective relativism—believing that there are no intellectual standards
by which to judge anything as true or false.

If we avoid these traps, if we recognize how we have been shaped by forces beyond our control, if we discover that there are skills that can help us begin to take charge of our minds, if we develop some initial confidence in reason, if we develop some intellectual humility and perseverance, we are ready to begin creating a genuine foundation on which we can rebuild our identity and character as thinkers and persons of integrity.


______Stage Four: The Practicing Thinker—Good Thinking Can Be Practiced Like Basketball___________________

if you are like most people, you can discover some practical starting points. The problem will be in following through on any that you find. This is the problem in most areas of skill development: People do not usually follow through. They do not establish habits of regular practice. They are discouraged by the strain and awkwardness of early attempts to perform well.
Ultimately, success comes to those who are persistent and who figure out strategies for themselves. 

If you want to become skilled at tennis, you improve not by expecting yourself to begin as
an expert player. You improve not by expecting to win every game you play or by mastering new strokes with little practice. Rather, you improve when you develop a plan that you can modify as you see what improves your "game." Today you may decide to work on keeping your eye on the ball. Tomorrow you may coordinate watching the ball with following through as you swing. Every day you rethink your strategies for improvement.

----------1------------
you could spend that time, or at least part of it, thinking back over your day and evaluating your strengths and weaknesses. You might ask yourself questions like these:

-When did I do my worst thinking today?
-When did I do my best thinking?
-What did I actually think about -today?
-Did I figure out anything?
-Did I allow any negative thinking to frustrate me unnecessarily?
-If I had to repeat today, what would I do differently? Why?
-Did I do anything today to further my long-term goals?
-Did I do what I set out to do? Why or why not?
-Did I act in accordance with my own expressed values?

It also would be useful (perhaps in a daily journal) to record your observations . As time passes, you also will be able to look back and search for patterns in your daily thinking and in your

--------2---------------
Handle a problem a day. 

At the beginning of each day (perhaps driving to work), choose a problem to work on when you have free moments. Figure out the logic of the problem by identifying its elements.
Systematically think through the questions: What exactly is the problem? How can I put it into the form of a question?

----------3-----------
Work each week on a skill

Focus one week on clarity, the next on accuracy, and so on.
For example, if you are focusing on clarity for the week, try to notice when you are being unclear in
communicating with others. Notice when others are unclear in what they are saying. When you are reading,
notice whether you are clear about what you are reading. When you write a memo, ask yourself whether
you are clear about what you are trying to say and in conveying your thoughts in writing. 

you will practice four techniques of clarification:
 1) stating what you are saying with some consideration given to your choice of words 
 2) elaborating on your meaning in other words
 3) giving examples of what you mean from experiences you have had
 4) using analogies, metaphors, pictures, or diagrams to illustrate what you mean. You will state, elaborate, illustrate, and exemplify your points, and you will regularly ask others to do the same.
-----------------4-------------------
Each week, write out a certain number of journal entries. The steps are to:
-Describe only situations that are emotionally significant to you (situations you care deeply about);
-Describe only one situation at a time;
-Describe (and keep this separate) what you did in response to that situation (being specific and
exact)
Analyze, in the light of what you have written, what precisely was going on in the situation; dig
beneath the surface;
Assess the implications of your analysis. (What did you learn about yourself? What would you do
differently if you could relive the situation?)

---------5----------------
Practice intellectual strategies

---------6--------------
Reshape your character. Choose one intellectual trait to strive for each month, focusing on how you can
develop that trait in yourself. For example, concentrating on intellectual humility, begin to notice when you
admit you are wrong. 

--------7------------
Deal with your ego. Daily, begin to observe your egocentric thinking in action by contemplating questions
like these: As I reflect upon my behavior today, did I ever become irritable over small things? Did I do or say
anything irrational to get my way? Did I try to impose my will upon others? 

------------8------------------
